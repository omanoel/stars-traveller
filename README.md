# Stars Traveller v2.3.3

The goal of this web application is to simulate a traveller in a space ship, which wants to navigate between stars. It's in 3D view, and the stars are extracted from the HYG catalog (among 110 000 stars)

## Development / Build

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` or `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

A demo is accessible at http://manoloexpo.free.fr/__experimentations/stars-traveller/index.html
